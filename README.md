git clone https://github.com/adam-kb/exercise-app-public.git
cd exercise-app-public
```

### 2. Create a `.env` File

Copy the example environment file:

cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure the values in `.env` match your Docker container setup. The provided defaults should work for most local environments.

### 3. Run the Project Setup

Choose one of the following:

**Option A: npm script**

```bash
npm run setup:all
```

**Option B: bash script**

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install dependencies
- Start Docker containers
- Generate the Prisma client
- Push the database schema
- Seed the database

### 4. Start the Development Server

npm run dev
```

Open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Media Folder

The app serves images from the `/media` directory. These include exercise thumbnails and other static content.

If you're running the project locally:
- Add placeholder images to `/media/thumbnails/` if none exist
- You may include your own demo images
- The `.gitkeep` file ensures this directory is versioned even if empty
